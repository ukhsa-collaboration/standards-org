# UKHSA Organisational Standards

Welcome to the UKHSA organisational standards. This repository contains standards, guidelines and best practices that define how we do engineering at UKHSA and what we expect from our teams and partners.

## Purpose

### When to use these guidelines

## Development container image

A container image for developing documentation is defined in this repository in the `Dockerfile`.
This image is designed to only be used in the development environment as an aid for creating documentation so that it can be previewed before adding it to this repository's configuration for publication.
This also means documentation owners don't need to clone and use this repository to view their documentation, they can just use the image.

To build the image from the root of this repository:

```bash
docker build . -t ghrc.io/ukhsa-collaboration/standards-org
```

At present, there is only a `latest` tag for this image.

Using the image is detailed in the [standards-template](https://github.com/ukhsa-collaboration/standards-template) repository, however, for convenience here is the basic usage command:

```bash
docker run -p "8080:8080" -v "./docs:/site/docs/<name>" ghrc.io/ukhsa-collaboration/standards-org
```

where `<name>` is the path you wish the docs to be made available under when viewing them.
This `<name>` must match the name of the `<name>.11tydata.json` data file in the documentation repo's docs/ dir.
It's recommended that you use the real path (e.g. `api-design-guidelines`) you will be publishing the docs under on the standards org site as this means you can check everything will work when published, e.g. relative links.

When running the above `docker run ...` command, this runs Eleventy with the `--watch`, enabling you to just run the command once and any updates will be picked up automatically.

### Linting the Dockerfile

The Dockerfile will be linted and validated after pushing using the `build-dev-container.yml` workflow, however, if you
want to run these checks locally you can:

```bash
# validate the dockerfile with docker
docker build --check .

# lint the dockerfile with hadolint
docker run --rm -i -v "./.hadolint.yaml:/.hadolint.yaml" hadolint/hadolint < Dockerfile
```
